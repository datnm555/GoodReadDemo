You’re building a backend service to support the goodreads mobile app. Please build a set of APIs that would allow a user to do the following activities:

1. Add a book to the list of books they have read

2. View a list of books they have completed reading

3. Search for a book by name We’re looking only for APIs, no Frontend is needed. Please make sure that the APIs are RESTful.
